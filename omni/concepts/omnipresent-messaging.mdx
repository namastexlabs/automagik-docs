## The Vision

**Omnipresent messaging** is the north star of Automagik OMNI - a future where your AI agent doesn't just exist on multiple platforms, but truly understands **who you are** regardless of where you message from.

## The Intelligent Postman Analogy

Think of OMNI as an **intelligent postman** who:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Knows Every Address" icon="map">
    WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, Instagram, Teams - every platform is a familiar route
  </Card>

  <Card title="Speaks Every Language" icon="language">
    Different protocols, APIs, webhooks - all translated seamlessly
  </Card>

  <Card title="Never Gets Lost" icon="compass">
    Messages always reach the right destination, formatted correctly
  </Card>

  <Card title="Remembers Everyone" icon="brain">
    Recognises you whether you send a letter, email, or text message
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Current State: Present, Not Omnipresent

### What Works Today (November 2025)

OMNI successfully enables AI agents to be **present** on multiple platforms:

- ✅ **WhatsApp**: Full messaging with media, reactions, presence
- ✅ **Discord**: Multi-server support with text and attachments
- ✅ **Independent Operation**: Each channel functions reliably
- ✅ **Multi-Tenant**: Multiple isolated instances per platform

<Info>
**Current Reality**: Your agent can respond on WhatsApp and Discord simultaneously, but it doesn't know that "john@discord" and "+44123456789@whatsapp" are the same person.
</Info>

### The Missing Piece: Unified Context

Today's limitation is **contextual isolation**:

```yaml
Scenario: User switches platforms mid-conversation

WhatsApp (10:00):
  User: "Hey, I'm looking for hiking boots"
  Agent: "Great! What's your budget?"

Discord (10:05):
  User: "I saw some on your site earlier"
  Agent: "Hello! What can I help you with?" ❌
  # Agent doesn't remember WhatsApp conversation
```

<Warning>
**The Gap**: Each platform operates independently. The agent is **present everywhere** but not **omnipresent** - it lacks the unified context to recognise you across platforms.
</Warning>

---

## The Future: True Omnipresence

### Unified User Management

The roadmap to omnipresence centres on **linking user identities** across platforms:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Identity Linking">
    Connect "john@discord", "+44123456789@whatsapp", and "john_doe@slack" as the same person
  </Step>

  <Step title="Cross-Platform Context">
    Share conversation history, preferences, and state across all channels
  </Step>

  <Step title="Seamless Handoffs">
    Continue conversations naturally regardless of platform switches
  </Step>

  <Step title="Unified Analytics">
    Understand user behaviour holistically, not per-platform silos
  </Step>
</Steps>

### How It Will Work

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant W as WhatsApp
    participant O as OMNI Hub
    participant D as Discord
    participant A as AI Agent
    participant C as Context Store

    U->>W: "Find me hiking boots"
    W->>O: Message received
    O->>C: Fetch user context
    C-->>O: User: john_doe, History: []
    O->>A: Process with context
    A-->>O: "What's your budget?"
    O->>C: Store: boot search started
    O->>W: Send response

    Note over U,C: User switches to Discord

    U->>D: "Under £100"
    D->>O: Message received
    O->>C: Fetch user context
    C-->>O: User: john_doe, History: [boot search]
    O->>A: Process with full context ✅
    A-->>O: "Perfect! I found 3 options..."
    O->>D: Send response with continuity
```

### Real-World Example

Imagine this seamless experience:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="WhatsApp Morning">
    ```
    User (WhatsApp, 09:00):
    "I saw a cool product on Instagram -
     the wireless earbuds with active noise cancellation"

    Agent:
    "I found them! The AirPods Pro Max.
     Would you like me to check stock and pricing?"
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Discord Afternoon">
    ```
    User (Discord, 14:00):
    "What was that product you showed me earlier?"

    Agent:
    "The AirPods Pro Max you asked about this morning.
     They're £549 and in stock. Ready to order?"

    # Agent remembers across platforms! ✅
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Slack Evening">
    ```
    User (Slack, 18:00):
    "Did that order go through?"

    Agent:
    "Your AirPods Pro Max order from this afternoon
     is confirmed. Delivery: Friday. Tracking: ABC123"

    # Full continuity across WhatsApp → Discord → Slack
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Technical Architecture for Omnipresence

### User Identity Graph

```python
# Future: Unified user profile
{
  "user_id": "unified_john_doe_123",
  "identities": {
    "whatsapp": "+44123456789",
    "discord": "john@discord#1234",
    "slack": "U0123456789",
    "instagram": "@john_doe"
  },
  "preferences": {
    "language": "en-GB",
    "timezone": "Europe/London",
    "notification_preferences": {...}
  },
  "context": {
    "current_conversation": "product_search_boots",
    "history": [...],
    "state": {...}
  }
}
```

### Shared Context Store

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Conversation Continuity">
    Store active conversations with full history accessible across platforms:
    - Message threads
    - User intents
    - Pending actions
    - Follow-up reminders
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="User Preferences">
    Remember settings regardless of platform:
    - Communication style
    - Response preferences
    - Privacy settings
    - Custom configurations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cross-Platform State">
    Maintain state machines that work everywhere:
    - Shopping carts
    - Form submissions
    - Multi-step workflows
    - Pending approvals
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Platform Coverage** | ✅ Multiple channels | ✅ Multiple channels |
| **Message Delivery** | ✅ Reliable sending | ✅ Reliable sending |
| **User Recognition** | ❌ Per-platform only | ✅ Cross-platform linking |
| **Context Sharing** | ❌ Isolated per channel | ✅ Unified context store |
| **Conversation Flow** | ❌ Starts fresh each platform | ✅ Continues seamlessly |
| **User Preferences** | ⚠️ Per-instance settings | ✅ Global user preferences |
| **Analytics** | ⚠️ Per-channel metrics | ✅ Unified user insights |

## Privacy & Security Considerations

<Warning>
**Privacy First**: Omnipresence must respect user privacy and consent.
</Warning>

### Guiding Principles

1. **Opt-In Only**: Users explicitly consent to cross-platform linking
2. **Transparent Control**: Clear visibility into linked identities
3. **Easy Unlinking**: One-click to separate platform identities
4. **Data Minimisation**: Only store necessary context
5. **Compliance Ready**: GDPR, CCPA, and regional regulations

### User Control Dashboard

```yaml
Future Feature: Identity Management
- View all linked platforms
- Revoke specific platform links
- Export all data
- Delete cross-platform context
- Platform-specific privacy settings
```

## What is Omni?

Omni is a **multi-tenant messaging hub** that connects AI agents to WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, and more through a single, unified API. MCP-native and built for scale, Omni eliminates the integration hell of connecting AI to real-world communication channels.

## The Problem

Connecting AI agents to messaging platforms is painful:
- **Multiple APIs**: Each platform has different protocols
- **Custom Code**: Every integration requires weeks of development
- **No Standards**: No common protocol for messaging
- **Tenant Isolation**: Hard to manage multiple clients/instances
- **Maintenance Burden**: Updates and changes across all platforms

## The Solution

Omni provides **universal messaging connectivity** for AI agents:

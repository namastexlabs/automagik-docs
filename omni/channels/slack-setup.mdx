## Alternative Solutions (For Now)

While Slack integration is in development, you can:

### Option 1: Use Webhooks

```bash
# Send to Slack via incoming webhook
curl -X POST https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Message from OMNI agent",
    "channel": "#general"
  }'
```

### Option 2: Slack API Direct

```bash
# Use Slack API directly from your agent
curl -X POST https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer xoxb-your-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "channel": "C1234567890",
    "text": "Direct Slack API call"
  }'
```

### Option 3: Third-Party Bridges

- Zapier integration
- IFTTT workflows
- n8n automation
- Make.com scenarios

<Warning>
These workarounds lack OMNI's unified interface, message tracing, and multi-tenant architecture.
</Warning>

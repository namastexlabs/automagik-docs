## What is Automagik Tools?

**Automagik Tools** is the **universal MCP (Model Context Protocol) generator** - transforming any API into an intelligent AI agent in seconds. Think of it as the bridge between your APIs and AI, enabling natural language control of any system without writing integration code.

Point to an OpenAPI spec, get an AI-ready agent. No code generation, no complex setup—just instant intelligence.

## The Problem

Connecting AI to real-world systems is broken:

- **Weeks of Development**: Creating MCP integrations takes 2-4 weeks per API
- **Zero Standardization**: Every team reinvents the wheel differently
- **Maintenance Nightmare**: APIs change, everything breaks
- **No Reusability**: Can't share integrations across projects
- **Complex Deployment**: Getting to production is a full-time job
- **Expertise Required**: Need deep technical knowledge to create MCPs

**The Real Cost**: Companies spend **R$ 45,000 and 3 weeks** per integration. For 10 APIs, that's **R$ 450,000** and nearly a year of developer time.

## The Solution

Automagik Tools **flips the script completely**:

## Key Features

### 🧞 Genie: Universal Orchestrator
The crown jewel - a meta-agent that coordinates unlimited MCP servers with persistent memory:

graph LR
    A[Your Instructions] --> B[Genie]
    B --> C[MCP Server 1]
    B --> D[MCP Server 2]
    B --> E[MCP Server N]
    C --> F[Persistent Memory]
    D --> F
    E --> F
    F --> B
```

## Real-World Magic

### Stripe Payments in 30 Seconds
```bash
uvx automagik-tools openapi https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stripe/openapi/master/openapi/spec3.json

# Now just talk to it:
# "Process a $100 payment for customer cus_123"
# "Show me failed payments from last week"
# "Create a subscription for Pro plan"
```

### Discord Bot Without Code
```bash
uvx automagik-tools openapi \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/discord/discord-api-spec/main/specs/openapi.json \
  -t sse --port 8001

# Natural language commands:
# "Schedule a voice call for 3pm in the dev channel"
# "Find all threads mentioning the new feature"
```

### Your Internal API, AI-Ready
```bash
# Your company's API becomes conversational
uvx automagik-tools openapi https://api.yourcompany.com/openapi.json

# Team shares the same learning agent via SSE
# Agent adapts to company terminology and workflows
```

## The Evolution of Integration

**Traditional Development**: 3 weeks × R$ 15k = **R$ 45,000 per integration**

**With Automagik Tools**: 30 seconds × R$ 200 = **R$ 100 per integration**

**Savings**: **R$ 44,900 per integration** (99% cost reduction)

For 10 integrations/year:
- Traditional cost: **R$ 450,000**
- Automagik Tools: **R$ 1,000** + R$ 24k/year Enterprise
- **ROI: 1,770%**

## Philosophy

Automagik Tools embodies our core philosophy:

<Card title="AI that elevates human potential, not replaces it" icon="users">
  - **You orchestrate** - Agents execute
  - **You describe** - Agents implement
  - **You decide** - Agents suggest
  - **You own** - No vendor lock-in
  - **You control** - Open source, self-hostable
</Card>

## Why "Automagik Tools"?

Just like magic seems impossible until you understand how it works, **Automagik Tools makes the complex simple**. Transforming weeks of integration work into 30 seconds feels like magic—but it's just **excellent engineering**.

The "Tools" part? Every great builder needs the right tools. We're building tools that give AI agents the power to interact with any system, anywhere.

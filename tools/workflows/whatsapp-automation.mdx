## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Evolution API">
    ```bash
    # Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
    docker run -d \
      --name evolution-api \
      -p 8080:8080 \

    # Option 2: Manual installation
    git clone https://github.com/EvolutionAPI/evolution-api
    cd evolution-api
    npm install
    npm run start:prod
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Environment">
    ```bash
    # Create .env file
    cat > .env <<EOF
    EVOLUTION_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
    EVOLUTION_API_KEY=your_evolution_api_key
    EOF
    ```

    Get your API key from Evolution API dashboard at `http://localhost:8080/manager`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Tools with Evolution API">
    ```bash
    # Run Tools with Evolution API integration

    # Tools is now ready to manage WhatsApp!
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect WhatsApp">
    Use your AI agent to connect:

    ```
    You: "Create a new WhatsApp instance called 'customer-support'"

    AI: [Uses evolution_create_instance]
    ✓ Instance created: customer-support

    You: "Get QR code to connect WhatsApp"

    AI: [Uses evolution_get_qr_code]
    [QR Code Image Displayed]

    Scan this QR code with WhatsApp to connect.
    ```

    Scan the QR code with WhatsApp → WhatsApp Web → Linked Devices
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Automating">
    ```
    You: "Send 'Hello!' to +1234567890"

    AI: [Uses evolution_send_text_message]

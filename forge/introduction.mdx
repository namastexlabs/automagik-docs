## What is Forge?

Forge is the **maestro of AI-powered development** - transforming "vibe coding" chaos into structured productivity. A Kanban board that not only organizes tasks but executes them through any AI agent (Claude, Gemini, Cursor, and more), with Git worktree isolation and multi-agent orchestration.

## The Problem

AI-powered development often feels like this:
- **Lost Context**: Chat histories disappear, ideas get forgotten
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Stuck with a single AI provider
- **Chaos**: No clear organization or task management
- **Risk**: Experiments can break your main codebase
- **Comparison Paralysis**: Can't easily compare different AI approaches

## The Solution

Forge brings **structure to the creative chaos** of AI development:

  <Card title="Multi-LLM Support" icon="brain">
    Work with 8+ different LLMs simultaneously. Compare Claude against Gemini, test Cursor's suggestions, find the best tool for each task.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Git Worktree Isolation" icon="code-branch">
    Experiment fearlessly. Each task gets its own isolated workspace - your main codebase stays pristine while you explore.

## Why "Forge"?

A forge is where raw materials are **shaped into useful tools** through heat and hammering. Similarly, Forge takes the raw power of AI models and shapes them into structured, production-ready code through systematic workflows.

## Philosophy

Forge embodies our core philosophy:

<Card title="AI that elevates human potential, not replaces it" icon="users">
  - **You orchestrate** - AI executes
  - **You decide** - AI suggests
  - **You understand** - AI explains
  - **You own** - No vendor lock-in

## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Automagik Forge?">
    Automagik Forge is a **Vibe Coding++™ platform** that brings structure to AI-assisted development. It's a visual Kanban board where you plan tasks, choose AI agents to execute them in isolated git worktrees, compare results from multiple agents, and ship code you understand.

    **Key Features:**
    - Visual task management Kanban
    - 8+ AI coding agent integrations (Claude, Cursor, Gemini, etc.)
    - Git worktree isolation for safe experimentation
    - Multiple attempts per task (try different agents)
    - MCP server for AI agent integration
    - 100% open source and self-hostable
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is Forge different from regular AI coding?">
    **Regular "Vibe Coding" (Chaotic):**
    - Chat with AI, get code, ship it
    - Lost in chat history
    - Code breaks in 2 weeks
    - No experimentation or comparison
    - Vendor lock-in to one AI

    **Vibe Coding++™ with Forge (Structured):**
    - You plan tasks in persistent Kanban
    - AI agents execute in isolated worktrees
    - Compare multiple agent approaches
    - Review and understand before merge
    - Code stays maintainable
    - No vendor lock-in (8+ agents supported)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is Forge free?">
    **Yes!** Forge is **100% free and open source** (MIT License).

    - No subscription fees
    - No usage limits
    - Self-hostable on your machine
    - No vendor lock-in
    - Community-driven development

    **Costs you pay:**
    - AI agent API costs (Claude, Gemini, etc.) - BYOL (Bring Your Own LLM)
    - Or use free/open-source agents (OpenCode, Qwen Code)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which AI coding agents does Forge support?">
    Forge supports **8+ AI coding agents**:

    **Commercial Agents:**
    - **Claude Code** (Anthropic) - Best for complex logic, security
    - **Cursor CLI** - Modern React patterns, frontend
    - **Gemini** (Google) - Fast iterations, good all-rounder
    - **OpenAI Codex** - GPT-4 based coding
    - **Amp** (Sourcegraph) - Code intelligence

    **Open Source/Local Agents:**
    - **OpenCode** - Free, runs locally
    - **Qwen Code** (Alibaba) - Open source
    - **Claude Router** - LLM-agnostic, use ANY model

    Plus: You can add custom agents!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to pay for multiple AI subscriptions?">
    **No!** You only need API access to the agents you want to use.

    **Options:**
    1. **Single AI** - Use just Claude or just Gemini
    2. **Free Agents** - Use OpenCode or Qwen (100% free)
    3. **Pay-as-you-go** - Most AI APIs are pay-per-use, not subscriptions

    **Recommendation:**
    - Start with one AI (Claude Code or Gemini)
    - Add more later to compare approaches
    - Use free agents for experimentation
  </Accordion>

## Technical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does git worktree isolation work?">
    **Git worktrees** allow multiple working directories from one repository.

    **Normal git workflow:**
    ```bash
    git checkout feature-branch  # Switches your code
    # Risk: Can break your main branch
    ```

    **Forge worktree workflow:**
    ```bash
    # Main repo stays on main branch
    # Each task gets isolated worktree
    .forge/worktrees/task-1-attempt-1/  # AI works here
    .forge/worktrees/task-2-attempt-1/  # Another task here

    # Your main codebase is never touched
    # Review results, merge when ready
    ```

    **Benefits:**
    - Multiple tasks execute simultaneously
    - Main branch stays clean
    - Safe experimentation
    - Easy rollback
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are task attempts?">
    **Attempts** let you try the same task with different AI agents.

    **Example:**
    ```
    Task: "Add user authentication"

    Attempt 1: Claude Code → Comprehensive but complex
    Attempt 2: Gemini → Simple but missing edge cases
    Attempt 3: Cursor → Perfect balance ✅

    You choose: Attempt 3 to merge
    ```

    **Benefits:**
    - Compare different approaches
    - Learn which agent works best for what
    - No risk (each in isolated worktree)
    - Choose best implementation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Forge without git?">
    **No**, Forge requires a git repository.

    **Why:**
    - Git worktrees provide isolation
    - Version control tracks changes
    - Safe rollback if needed

    **Quick setup if you don't have git:**
    ```bash
    cd your-project
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"

    # Now run Forge
    automagik-forge
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Forge work with monorepos?">
    **Yes!** Forge works great with monorepos.

    Each sub-project can have its own Forge instance:

    ```bash
    # Frontend
    cd monorepo/frontend
    automagik-forge --port 3000

    # Backend
    cd monorepo/backend
    automagik-forge --port 3001

    # Mobile
    cd monorepo/mobile
    automagik-forge --port 3002
    ```

    Or use one Forge for entire monorepo with labeled tasks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Forge in CI/CD?">
    **Not recommended.** Forge is designed for **development**, not CI/CD.

    **Instead, use Forge to:**
    - Develop features locally
    - Review AI-generated code
    - Merge to main when approved

    **Then use normal CI/CD:**
    - GitHub Actions
    - GitLab CI
    - Jenkins
    - etc.

    Forge tasks create branches → you review → merge → CI/CD runs.

## Troubleshooting Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why is my task execution failing?">
    **Common causes:**

    1. **API Key Issues:**
       ```bash
       # Verify API key is set
       echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY  # For Claude

       # Set if missing
       export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
       ```

    2. **Git Issues:**
       ```bash
       # Ensure you're in a git repo
       git status

       # Commit uncommitted changes
       git add .
       git commit -m "Save work"
       ```

    3. **Executor Not Configured:**
       ```bash
       # Check executors enabled
       cat .forge/config.json | jq '.executors'

       # Enable in UI: Settings → Executors
       ```

    4. **Worktree Issues:**
       ```bash
       # Clean up old worktrees
       git worktree prune
       rm -rf .forge/worktrees/*
       ```

    See [Troubleshooting](/forge/troubleshooting/common-issues) for more.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I clean up old worktrees?">
    **Via UI (Recommended):**
    - Settings → Cleanup → Remove Old Worktrees

    **Manually:**
    ```bash
    # Remove all worktree directories
    rm -rf .forge/worktrees/*

    # Prune git references
    git worktree prune

    # Restart Forge
    automagik-forge
    ```

    **Automatically:**
    ```json
    // In .forge/config.json
    {
      "worktrees": {
        "auto_delete_merged": true,
        "cleanup_on_exit": true
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is Forge consuming so much disk space?">
    **Causes:**
    - Many git worktrees (each is full code copy)
    - Large git repository
    - Many task attempts
    - Database growth

    **Solutions:**

    1. **Clean up worktrees:**
       ```bash
       rm -rf .forge/worktrees/*
       git worktree prune
       ```

    2. **Clean up database:**
       ```bash
       sqlite3 .forge/db.sqlite "DELETE FROM tasks WHERE status='done' AND updated_at < datetime('now', '-30 days');"
       sqlite3 .forge/db.sqlite "VACUUM;"
       ```

    3. **Enable auto-cleanup:**
       ```json
       {
         "worktrees": {
           "auto_delete_merged": true,
           "max_concurrent": 3
         }
       }
       ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I run Forge on a server/headless?">
    **Yes**, but with limitations.

    **Headless mode:**
    ```bash
    # Start backend only
    BACKEND_PORT=5000 automagik-forge

    # Access via API
    curl http://server-ip:5000/api/projects

    # Or use MCP mode
    automagik-forge --mcp
    ```

    **Limitations:**
    - No web UI (can build separately and point to API)
    - Need to manage via API or MCP only
    - GitHub OAuth requires redirect to localhost

    **Better approach:**
    - Run Forge on your local machine
    - Use git/GitHub to share code changes
    - Each developer has own Forge instance
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I create custom AI agents?">
    **Yes!** You can add custom executors.

    **Example custom agent:**
    ```json
    // In .forge/config.json
    {
      "executors": {
        "my-custom-agent": {
          "enabled": true,
          "type": "http",
          "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/execute",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer ${CUSTOM_AGENT_TOKEN}"
          },
          "timeout": 600000
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Your custom agent must accept Forge's execution API format.

    See [Custom Executors](/forge/advanced/custom-executors) for details.

       .forge/
       .env
       ```

    2. **Restrict file permissions:**
       ```bash
       chmod 600 .forge/config.json
       chmod 700 .forge/
       ```

    3. **Use environment variables for secrets:**
       ```bash
       export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
       # Not in config files
       ```

    4. **Backup important data:**
       ```bash
       cp -r .forge .forge-backup
       ```

    Forge is 100% self-hosted. You control your data.

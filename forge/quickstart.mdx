## Your First AI-Powered Task in 5 Minutes

This guide will walk you through creating your first task with Forge, comparing outputs from multiple LLMs, and shipping code you understand.

---

## Step 1: Initialize Forge

Make sure you're in a Git repository, then initialize Forge:

```bash
# Make sure you're in a Git repo
git init  # if not already a Git repo

# Initialize Forge
forge init
```

This creates a `.forge/` directory with your configuration.

---

## Step 2: Configure Your LLMs

Edit `.forge/config.json` to add your API keys:

```json
{
  "llms": {
    "claude": {
      "apiKey": "sk-ant-...",
      "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
    },
    "gemini": {
      "apiKey": "AIza...",
      "model": "gemini-2.0-flash-exp"
    }
  },
  "worktrees": {
    "enabled": true,
    "basePath": "./.forge/worktrees"
  }
}
```

<Tip>
Start with just one LLM if you're trying it out. You can add more later to compare results!
</Tip>

---

## Step 3: Create Your First Task

Open the Forge UI or use the CLI:

```bash
# Start Forge UI
forge start

# Or create task via CLI
forge task create \
  --title "Add user authentication" \
  --description "Implement JWT-based authentication with login and signup endpoints" \
  --llm claude
```

The Forge UI will open at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Step 4: Let AI Work in Isolation

Forge creates a Git worktree for your task, keeping your main branch clean:

```bash
# Forge automatically creates a worktree
# Your task runs in: .forge/worktrees/task-1-add-auth

# Your main branch is untouched!
# You can keep working on other things
```

---

## Step 5: Review and Compare

If you're using multiple LLMs, Forge shows you side-by-side results:

```bash
# Compare Claude vs Gemini on the same task
forge task compare 1

# See the differences
forge diff task-1-claude task-1-gemini
```

Choose the approach you understand best, or combine elements from both!

---

## Step 6: Merge When Ready

Once you're happy with the result:

```bash
# Review changes
forge task review 1

# Merge into main
forge task merge 1

# Cleanup worktree
forge task close 1
```

---

## Real-World Example

Here's a complete workflow for adding a new feature:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Task">
    ```bash
    forge task create \
      --title "Add dark mode toggle" \
      --description "Create a toggle component that switches between light and dark themes" \
      --llm claude \
      --labels "feature,ui"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="AI Generates Code">
    Forge creates a worktree and Claude generates:
    - Theme toggle component
    - CSS variables for themes
    - LocalStorage persistence
    - Tests
  </Step>

  <Step title="Try Another Approach">
    ```bash
    # Try with Gemini for comparison
    forge task fork 1 --llm gemini
    ```

    Now you have two implementations to compare!
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Both">
    ```bash
    # See them side-by-side
    forge task compare 1

    # Claude's approach: CSS-in-JS with styled-components
    # Gemini's approach: Tailwind CSS with data attributes
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose and Merge">
    ```bash
    # You prefer Gemini's Tailwind approach
    forge task merge 1-gemini

    # Clean up
    forge task close 1-claude
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pro Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Multiple LLMs for Complex Tasks">
    For important features, run the same task with 2-3 different LLMs and compare approaches:

    ```bash
    forge task create --title "Critical feature" --llm claude
    forge task fork 1 --llm gemini
    forge task fork 1 --llm gpt-4
    ```

    Choose the best implementation or cherry-pick from each!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep Tasks Small and Focused">
    Instead of:
    ```bash
    forge task create --title "Rebuild entire auth system"
    ```

    Do:
    ```bash
    forge task create --title "Add JWT token generation"
    forge task create --title "Add token validation middleware"
    forge task create --title "Add refresh token logic"
    ```

    Smaller tasks = better AI results!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Labels for Organization">
    ```bash
    forge task create \
      --title "Add search" \
      --labels "feature,ui,priority:high"

    # Filter by label
    forge task list --labels "priority:high"
    ```
  </Accordion>

### 1. Wish Workflow

**Purpose**: Define what you want to build

<Steps>
  <Step title="Capture Intent">
    Express your wish in natural language

    ```bash

  </Step>

  <Step title="Approval & Merge">
    - All checks pass
    - Reviews approved
    - Ready for merge
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Tech Council (Advisory Team)

The **Tech Council** is an advisory team for complex technical decisions:

<Card title="Tech Council Composition" icon="users">
**Members**:
- **architect** - System design perspective
- **security** - Security implications
- **performance** - Performance considerations
- **genie** - Independent pressure-testing
- **senior-dev** - Experience and wisdom

**When to Convene**:
- Major architecture decisions
- Breaking changes
- New technology adoption
- Complex refactoring
- Performance-critical changes
</Card>

```bash
# Convene Tech Council for decision
genie council tech "Evaluate GraphQL vs REST for new API"

# Council reviews and provides recommendations:
# - architect: "GraphQL provides flexibility..."
# - security: "Consider rate limiting implications..."
# - performance: "REST simpler, GraphQL requires careful query design..."
# - genie: "Alternative: Start with REST, add GraphQL later..."
```

---

## Publishing Protocol

The Code Collective follows a strict publishing protocol:

### Auto-RC on Merge

When code is merged to `main`:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Automatic RC Creation">
    - Generate RC version (e.g., `v1.2.0-rc.1`)
    - Create changelog
    - Tag release
  </Step>

  <Step title="RC Testing">
    - Deploy to staging
    - Run integration tests
    - Monitor for issues
  </Step>

  <Step title="Promotion to Stable">
    Manual promotion after validation:
    ```bash
    genie publish promote-rc v1.2.0-rc.1
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Stable Release">
    - Remove RC suffix
    - Publish to NPM
    - Create GitHub release
    - Announce to community
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Version Management

```bash
# Check current version
genie version current

# Create release candidate
genie publish rc "v1.2.0-rc.1"

# Promote to stable
genie publish promote "v1.2.0"

# View publishing history
genie publish history
```

---

## Using Code Collective Agents

### Summon Individual Agents

```bash
# Summon specific agent for a task
genie summon implementor "Build user registration endpoint"
genie summon tests "Create tests for registration"
genie summon git "Create PR for registration feature"
```

### Coordinated Multi-Agent Work

```bash
# Genie coordinates multiple agents automatically
genie forge wishes/user-registration.md

# Behind the scenes:
# 1. implementor writes code
# 2. tests creates tests
# 3. documenter adds docs
# 4. audit checks security
# 5. polish refines everything
# 6. git creates PR
```

### Tech Council Consultation

```bash
# Get expert opinions on complex decisions
genie council tech "Should we migrate from REST to GraphQL?"

# Council members provide perspectives:
# - architect: Design implications
# - performance: Performance impact
# - security: Security considerations
# - genie: Alternative approaches
```

---

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Let Agents Specialize">
    Don't ask one agent to do everything:

    **Good**:
    ```bash
    genie summon implementor "Build feature"
    genie summon tests "Test feature"
    genie summon documenter "Document feature"
    ```

    **Not Ideal**:
    ```bash
    genie summon implementor "Build, test, and document feature"
    # Better to let specialists handle each part
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Workflows for Coordination">
    Let workflows coordinate agents:

    ```bash
    # Workflow handles coordination
    genie forge wishes/feature.md

    # Rather than manual coordination:
    # genie summon implementor ...
    # genie summon tests ...
    # genie summon documenter ...
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Trust the Publishing Protocol">
    Follow the RC → Stable flow:

    1. Merge to main (auto RC creation)
    2. Test RC thoroughly
    3. Promote to stable when validated
    4. Never skip RC for significant changes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Leverage Tech Council">
    Use Tech Council for important decisions:

    - Architecture changes
    - Technology adoption
    - Breaking changes
    - Performance-critical work

    Don't use for routine decisions - they're busy!
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example Workflows

### Feature Development

```bash
# 1. Make a wish
genie wish "Add OAuth2 authentication"

# 2. Forge implementation (coordinates multiple agents)
genie forge wishes/oauth2-auth.md

# Agents involved:
# - architect: Design OAuth2 flow
# - implementor: Build authentication
# - security: Review security
# - tests: Create comprehensive tests
# - documenter: Document API
# - polish: Refine code

# 3. Review before merge
genie review wishes/oauth2-auth.md

# 4. Create PR
genie summon git "Create PR for OAuth2 authentication"

# 5. Merge → Auto RC created
git merge feature/oauth2

# 6. Test RC
genie test rc v2.0.0-rc.1

# 7. Promote to stable
genie publish promote v2.0.0-rc.1
```

### Bug Fix Workflow

```bash
# 1. Investigate
genie summon debug "Memory leak in WebSocket handler"

# 2. Implement fix
genie summon fix "Fix WebSocket memory leak based on debug findings"

# 3. Create regression test
genie summon tests "Add test to prevent WebSocket memory leak regression"

# 4. Review fix
genie summon reviewer "Review WebSocket fix"

# 5. Create PR
genie summon git "Create PR for WebSocket memory leak fix"
```

### Refactoring Workflow

```bash
# 1. Analyze codebase
genie summon analyzer "Analyze auth module for refactoring opportunities"

# 2. Get Tech Council input
genie council tech "Refactor auth to dependency injection pattern?"

# 3. Execute refactoring
genie summon refactor "Refactor auth module to use dependency injection"

# 4. Validate behavior unchanged
genie summon tests "Ensure all auth tests still pass"

# 5. Polish
genie summon polish "Polish refactored auth module"
```

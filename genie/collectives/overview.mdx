## What are Collectives?

**Collectives** are domain-specific containers that organize everything needed for specialized work: agents, spells (behavioral protocols), workflows (repeatable processes), and advisory teams.

Think of a Collective as a **department in your AI organization** - each with its own experts, playbooks, and processes.

## Collective Structure

Each Collective contains four key components:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Collective] --> B[Agents]
    A --> C[Spells]
    A --> D[Workflows]
    A --> E[Teams]

    B --> B1[Domain Specialists]
    B --> B2[Role-Based Experts]

    C --> C1[Behavioral Protocols]
    C --> C2[Decision Rules]

    D --> D1[Repeatable Processes]
    D --> D2[Multi-Step Workflows]

    E --> E1[Advisory Councils]
    E --> E2[Collaborative Groups]
```

### 1. Agents (Domain Specialists)

Specialized AI agents with deep expertise in the collective's domain:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Code Agents">
    - **implementor** - Feature implementation
    - **tests** - Test creation and validation
    - **git** - Git operations, PRs, releases
    - **debug** - Bug investigation
    - **audit** - Security analysis
    - 29+ more specialists
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Create Agents">
    - **researcher** - Information gathering
    - **writer** - Content creation
    - **editor** - Refinement and polish
    - **release-notes** - Beautiful release docs
    - **announcements** - Multi-platform messaging
    - 4+ more specialists
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Custom Agents">
    Create your own:
    - **analyst** - Financial analysis
    - **compliance** - Legal review
    - **designer** - UI/UX design
    - Whatever your domain needs
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Spells (Behavioral Protocols)

Reusable behavioral instructions that shape how agents work:

```markdown
# Example Spell: commit-advisory.md

## Purpose
Guide commit message creation following Conventional Commits

## Protocol
1. Analyze staged changes
2. Categorize change type (feat, fix, refactor, etc.)
3. Write concise, meaningful message
4. Include breaking change warnings if needed

## Output Format
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### 3. Workflows (Repeatable Processes)

Multi-step processes that coordinate agents:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Wish Workflow">
    Define what you want to build with structured specifications
  </Step>

  <Step title="Forge Workflow">
    Execute implementation with coordinated agents
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Workflow">
    Validate quality and ensure standards are met
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 4. Teams (Advisory Councils)

Groups of agents that collaborate on complex decisions:

- **Tech Council** (Code) - Architecture and technical decisions
- **Creative Council** (Create) - Content strategy and messaging
- **Custom Teams** - Domain-specific advisory groups

## How Collectives Work Together

Collectives are designed to **collaborate across domain boundaries**:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Code
    participant Create
    participant Custom

    User->>Code: "Build authentication feature"
    Code->>Code: implementor builds code
    Code->>Code: tests validates
    Code->>Create: "Need docs for auth API"
    Create->>Create: writer creates documentation
    Create->>Create: editor refines content
    Create->>Code: Returns documentation
    Code->>Custom: "Need compliance check"
    Custom->>Custom: compliance reviews security
    Custom->>Code: Approval with recommendations
    Code->>User: Complete feature with docs & compliance
```

### Cross-Collective Workflow Example

**Scenario**: Launch a new feature

<Steps>
  <Step title="Code Collective Builds">
    - **implementor** writes the feature code
    - **tests** creates comprehensive tests
    - **audit** runs security analysis
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Collective Documents">
    - **writer** creates user documentation
    - **editor** refines and polishes
    - **release-notes** generates beautiful release notes
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Collective Announces">
    - **announcements** creates multi-platform messages
    - Blog post, Twitter thread, Discord announcement
    - Email newsletter content
  </Step>

  <Step title="Code Collective Ships">
    - **git** agent creates release
    - **publish** agent deploys to production
    - Feature is live!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Concepts

### Shape-Shifting

Collectives (especially Create) can **become what you need**:

```bash
# Create becomes a technical writer
genie summon writer "Document the authentication API"

# Create becomes a marketer
genie summon announcements "Launch announcement for v2.0"

# Create becomes a researcher
genie summon researcher "Research best practices for JWT tokens"
```

### Collaborative Intelligence

Agents from different Collectives work together automatically:

- **Code** agent asks **Create** agent for documentation
- **Create** agent asks **Code** agent for technical details
- **Custom** agent consults **Code** and **Create** for cross-functional work

### Specialization vs. Flexibility

- **Code Collective**: Highly specialized, role-based agents
- **Create Collective**: Flexible, shape-shifting agents
- **Custom Collectives**: You decide the balance

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep Collectives Focused">
    Each Collective should have a clear domain:

    - **Good**: Code (technical), Create (content), Finance (financial)
    - **Bad**: "Everything" collective (too broad)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Design for Collaboration">
    Enable cross-Collective workflows:

    - Code agents can request documentation from Create
    - Create agents can query Code for technical details
    - Custom agents can leverage both
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Spells for Consistency">
    Create spells (behavioral protocols) for:

    - Consistent formatting
    - Decision-making rules
    - Quality standards
    - Domain-specific guidelines
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Build Reusable Workflows">
    Create workflows for:

    - Frequent multi-step processes
    - Cross-agent coordination
    - Quality gates
    - Publishing protocols
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

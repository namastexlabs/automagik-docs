## Why Create Custom Collectives?

While **Code** and **Create** collectives cover software development and content creation, your organization likely has domain-specific needs:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Industry-Specific Work" icon="industry">
    Finance, healthcare, legal, real estate, manufacturing - each has unique workflows
  </Card>

  <Card title="Organizational Processes" icon="building">
    Sales, HR, operations, compliance - internal processes need automation
  </Card>

  <Card title="Specialized Expertise" icon="graduation-cap">
    Data science, design, research, education - specialized disciplines
  </Card>

  <Card title="Custom Workflows" icon="diagram-project">
    Unique business processes that don't fit standard collectives
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Collective Directory Structure

A custom collective follows this structure:

```
.genie/
└── collectives/
    └── your-collective/
        ├── agents/               # Specialized agents

### Spell Template

```markdown
# Spell Name

## Purpose
What this spell guides agents to do

## Protocol
Step-by-step behavioral guidelines:
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

```

### Example: Financial Risk Assessment Spell

**File**: `.genie/collectives/finance/spells/risk-assessment.md`

```markdown
# Financial Risk Assessment Spell

## Purpose
Guide systematic evaluation of financial risks in business decisions

## Protocol

### 1. Identify Risk Categories
- Market risk
- Credit risk
- Liquidity risk
- Operational risk
- Regulatory risk

### 2. Quantify Each Risk
- Probability of occurrence (%)
- Potential impact ($)
- Risk score = Probability × Impact

### 3. Prioritize Risks
- Critical: Risk score > $1M
- High: Risk score $100K-$1M
- Medium: Risk score $10K-$100K
- Low: Risk score < $10K

### 4. Develop Mitigation Strategies
For each critical/high risk:
- Prevention measures
- Detection mechanisms
- Response plans
- Recovery procedures

### 5. Document Findings
- Risk register
- Mitigation plan
- Monitoring protocols

## Decision Rules

### When to Escalate
- Any critical risk identified
- Multiple high risks in same category
- New risks outside expected categories
- Risk trends worsening

### When to Deep Dive
- Risk score > $500K
- Low-probability but catastrophic impact
- Regulatory or compliance implications
- Affects multiple business units

### When to Accept
- Risk score < $10K
- Cost of mitigation > risk impact
- Risk is temporary and declining
- Already covered by insurance

## Quality Criteria

### Complete Risk Assessment
- All risk categories evaluated
- Quantitative and qualitative analysis
- Industry benchmarks considered
- Historical data analyzed

### Actionable Mitigation
- Specific, not generic recommendations
- Cost-benefit analysis included
- Implementation timeline defined
- Responsibility assigned

### Clear Communication
- Executive summary (1 page)
- Risk matrix visualization
- Plain language (avoid jargon)
- Action items prioritized

## Examples

### Good Risk Assessment
```
Risk: Customer concentration (80% revenue from top 3 clients)
- Probability: 30% chance of losing one in next year
- Impact: $2M revenue loss
- Risk Score: $600K (High)

Mitigation:
1. Diversify client base (add 10 new clients)
2. Strengthen relationships with top clients
3. Create client retention program
4. Build 6-month cash reserve

Timeline: 6 months
Owner: Sales Director
Cost: $150K
Benefit: Reduce risk score to $200K (Medium)
```

### Poor Risk Assessment
```
Risk: Business risk
Impact: Bad
Mitigation: Be careful

❌ Too vague
❌ Not quantified
❌ No actionable steps
```

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Analysis Paralysis
Don't spend months analyzing risks - make reasonable estimates and iterate

### ❌ Risk Theater
Don't create risk assessments just to check boxes - focus on actual risk reduction

### ❌ Ignoring Low-Probability/High-Impact
Don't dismiss risks just because they're unlikely - catastrophic risks need attention

### ❌ Static Risk Assessment
Don't treat risk assessment as one-time - risks change, reassess regularly
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Capital Investment Decision

**Question**: Should we invest $2M in new manufacturing equipment?

**Council Process**:

**CFO**: "We're considering $2M investment in equipment to increase capacity by 40%. Need council input."

**Analyst**:
- Current capacity utilization: 85%
- Projected demand growth: 30% over 3 years
- Equipment payback period: 4 years at current prices
- ROI: 18% over 7-year equipment life

**Risk Agent**:
- Market risk: Demand projections uncertain (Medium risk, $400K)
- Technology risk: Equipment could become obsolete (Low risk, $200K)
- Execution risk: Installation disruption (Medium risk, $300K)
- Overall risk score: $900K (Medium-High)
- Mitigation: Phased purchase, lease options, demand guarantees

**Auditor**:
- Requires board approval (>$1M)
- Depreciation impacts taxes
- Financing covenants allow this investment
- Environmental permits needed

**Forecaster**:
- Best case: 35% demand growth, payback 3.2 years
- Base case: 30% demand growth, payback 4 years
- Worst case: 20% demand growth, payback 6.5 years
- Sensitivity: Most sensitive to demand growth rate

**Recommendation**:
✅ **APPROVE with conditions**

Proceed with investment BUT:
1. Phase purchase: $1M now, $1M in Year 2
2. Secure demand commitments from top 3 customers
3. Evaluate lease vs. buy options
4. Set up monthly monitoring of capacity utilization

**Confidence Level**: 75%

**Dissenting Views**: None

**Action Items**:
1. CFO: Get board approval (2 weeks)
2. Operations: Secure customer commitments (3 weeks)
3. Finance: Evaluate lease options (2 weeks)
4. Operations: Plan installation schedule (4 weeks)

### Example 2: Pricing Strategy

**Question**: Should we increase prices by 15% to offset cost increases?

**Council Process**:

**Analyst**:
- Costs increased 12% due to supply chain
- Current margin: 35%
- With 15% price increase: 42% margin
- Competitor prices 8% higher than us currently

**Risk Agent**:
- Customer loss risk: HIGH (30% probability, $1.5M impact)
- Competitor response risk: MEDIUM (Need to monitor)
- Brand perception risk: MEDIUM (seen as expensive)

**Forecaster**:
- Best case: 15% increase, lose 5% customers = +$850K profit
- Base case: 15% increase, lose 15% customers = +$200K profit
- Worst case: 15% increase, lose 30% customers = -$400K profit

**Recommendation**:
⚠️ **DO NOT APPROVE 15% increase**

**Alternative**: Tiered approach
1. Immediate: 5% across-the-board increase
2. Month 3: Additional 3-5% for specific product lines
3. Month 6: Evaluate and adjust

This reduces customer shock and allows monitoring of response.

**Confidence Level**: 85%

**Dissenting Views**:
- Analyst believes we can do 10% immediately

**Action Items**:
1. Implement 5% increase (1 month)
2. Communicate value justification to customers
3. Monitor churn rates weekly
4. Re-evaluate at Month 3

## Best Practices

### Preparation
- Share background materials in advance
- Provide clear decision criteria
- Set time expectations

### Facilitation
- Ensure all voices heard
- Focus on data and reasoning
- Avoid groupthink
- Welcome disagreement

### Documentation
- Record all perspectives

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with Core Agents">
    Begin with 4-6 essential agents:

    **Good First Set**:
    - Primary executor agent
    - Quality reviewer agent
    - Risk/compliance agent
    - Subject matter expert agent

    **Don't**:
    - Create 30 agents immediately
    - Over-specialize too early
    - Duplicate existing collective capabilities
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Create Spells for Consistency">
    Spells ensure consistent behavior:

    ```markdown
    # Without Spell
    Each agent might assess risk differently

    # With risk-assessment.md Spell
    All agents use same methodology
    → Consistent, comparable results
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Design Workflows for Common Processes">
    Identify repeatable processes first:

    **High-Value Workflows**:
    - Frequent (weekly/monthly/quarterly)
    - Multi-step coordination
    - Quality-critical
    - Cross-agent collaboration

    **Low Priority**:
    - One-off tasks
    - Simple single-agent work
    - Ad-hoc requests
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Leverage Existing Collectives">
    Don't reinvent the wheel:

    ```bash
    # Your finance agent needs documentation
    # Use Create collective's writer
    genie summon writer "Document financial report format"

    # Your custom agent needs code review
    # Use Code collective's reviewer
    genie summon reviewer "Review financial API integration"
    ```

    Cross-collective collaboration is encouraged!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test Before Deploying">
    Validate your collective works:

    ```bash
    # Test individual agents
    genie summon your-agent "Test task"

    # Test workflows end-to-end
    genie forge .genie/collectives/your-collective/workflows/test.md

    # Test advisory team
    genie council your-team "Test decision"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Everything">
    Good documentation ensures:
    - Others can use your collective
    - You remember how it works later
    - Agents have clear guidelines
    - Quality stays consistent

    **Document**:
    - Agent capabilities and usage

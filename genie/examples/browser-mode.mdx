## What Is Browser Mode?

`genie talk` opens the Forge web UI for interactive chat with an agent.

**Not a terminal REPL** - Opens your browser.

## Start Browser Session

```bash
$ genie talk architect
Creating browser session...
Opening: http://localhost:8887/task/task-abc123
✅ Browser opened
```

**What opens:** Forge UI with chat interface

**CLI behavior:** Exits after opening browser (Forge keeps running)

## Browser Interface

You see:
- Chat input box
- Agent responses in real-time
- File tree (left sidebar)
- Diff view (for code changes)

Type messages directly in browser.

Agent responds using configured executor (Claude Code, OpenCode, etc.)

## Close Session

Just close the browser tab. Session stays in Forge.

View later:
```bash
$ genie list sessions
# Shows task-abc123

$ genie view task-abc123
# Full transcript
```

## When to Use Browser Mode

**Use browser mode when:**
- Interactive exploration
- Real-time feedback
- Visual diff review

**Use CLI mode when:**
- Automation/scripts
- Batch processing
- CI/CD pipelines

## Reality Check

This is NOT a magic AI interface. It's just:
1. Forge web UI (existing tool)
2. Opened by Genie CLI
3. Chat interface to agents

That's it.

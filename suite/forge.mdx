**Genie's Orchestration Backend**

Forge is the engine that powers Genie - handling multi-LLM orchestration, Git worktree isolation, and task management. When you install Genie, Forge is automatically included and runs in the background.

### Key Features

- **Multi-LLM Support**: Work with 8+ different LLMs simultaneously
- **Git Worktree Isolation**: Experiment safely without affecting your main codebase
- **Visual Kanban Board**: Track AI-driven tasks with an intuitive interface
- **Result Comparison**: Compare outputs from different AI models side-by-side
- **Production-Ready**: Ship code you actually understand and can maintain

<Info>
**For most users**: You don't need to install Forge separately. It's automatically installed when you install Genie.

### Installation

**Recommended: Install with Genie**

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://install.namastex.ai/get-genie.sh)"
```

This installs both Genie CLI and Forge backend together.

<Accordion title="Advanced: Standalone Forge Installation">
  If you need to run Forge without Genie (rare):

  ```bash
  npm install -g automagik-forge
  ```

  Most users won't need this - Genie is the intended interface to Forge.

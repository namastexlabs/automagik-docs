## Deploy Your First Agent Team in 5 Minutes

This guide will walk you through creating a multi-agent team with Hive, complete with memory, RAG, and MCP integration.

---

## Step 1: Initialize Hive

```bash
# Initialize Hive workspace
hive init

# This creates:
# - .hive/ directory
# - agents.yaml (your agent configuration)
# - .env (API keys)
```

---

## Step 2: Configure Your Agents

Edit `agents.yaml` to define your team:

```yaml
version: "1.0"

agents:
  - name: researcher
    role: "Research information and gather data"
    llm: claude
    model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
    memory: true
    tools:
      - web-search
      - wikipedia

  - name: coder
    role: "Write and review code"
    llm: claude
    model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
    memory: true
    tools:
      - bash
      - edit-file
      - read-file

  - name: analyst
    role: "Analyze data and create reports"
    llm: claude
    model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
    memory: true
    tools:
      - python
      - data-viz

memory:
  type: vector
  provider: qdrant
  persist: true
  path: ./.hive/memory

mcp:
  enabled: true
```

---

## Step 3: Set API Keys

Edit `.env` with your credentials:

```bash
# Required
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here

# Optional (based on your needs)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-key

# Memory (if using Qdrant)
QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333
```

<Tip>
Start with in-memory storage for quick testing! Just set `provider: in-memory` in agents.yaml.
</Tip>

---

## Step 4: Start Hive

```bash
# Start Hive with hot-reload enabled
hive start --hot-reload

# You should see:
# üêù Hive v1.0.0
# ‚úì Agents spawned: researcher, coder, analyst
# ‚úì Memory system initialized
# ‚úì Hot-reload enabled
```

---

## Step 5: Give Your Team a Task

```bash
# Assign a task to your research agent
hive task assign researcher "Research the latest trends in AI agents and summarize key findings"

# Or use the team coordinator
hive task create "Build a simple web scraper for tech news" --assign-to coder
```

---

## Real-World Example: Research & Development Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Research Phase">
    ```bash
    hive task assign researcher \
      "Research best practices for building REST APIs in Python"
    ```

    The researcher agent:
    - Searches the web
    - Reads documentation
    - Stores findings in memory
  </Step>

  <Step title="Development Phase">
    ```bash
    hive task assign coder \
      "Build a REST API based on the research findings" \
      --context "Use the research from the previous task"
    ```

    The coder agent:
    - Accesses research from memory
    - Writes implementation code
    - Creates tests
  </Step>

  <Step title="Analysis Phase">
    ```bash
    hive task assign analyst \
      "Analyze the API implementation and create performance recommendations"
    ```

    The analyst agent:
    - Reviews the code
    - Analyzes architecture
    - Generates report
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Agent Team Configurations

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Content Creation Team">
    ```yaml
    agents:
      - name: researcher
        role: "Research topics and gather sources"
        tools: [web-search, wikipedia]

      - name: writer
        role: "Create engaging content"
        tools: [write-file]

      - name: editor
        role: "Review and improve content"
        tools: [read-file, edit-file]
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Development Team">
    ```yaml
    agents:
      - name: architect
        role: "Design system architecture"
        tools: [diagram, plantuml]

      - name: frontend-dev
        role: "Build UI components"
        tools: [bash, npm, read-file, write-file]

      - name: backend-dev
        role: "Implement APIs and services"
        tools: [bash, docker, read-file, write-file]

      - name: qa-tester
        role: "Test and validate"
        tools: [bash, pytest]
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Data Analysis Team">
    ```yaml
    agents:
      - name: data-collector
        role: "Gather and clean data"
        tools: [web-scrape, api-call, pandas]

      - name: data-scientist
        role: "Analyze and model data"
        tools: [python, jupyter, sklearn]

      - name: visualizer
        role: "Create charts and dashboards"
        tools: [matplotlib, plotly, dash]
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using Memory and RAG

Agents automatically remember context:

```bash
# Agent stores information
hive task assign researcher "Research Python async best practices"

# Later, another agent can access this knowledge
hive task assign coder "Write async code using best practices" \
  --use-memory

# Query memory directly
hive memory search "async best practices"
```

---

## Hot-Reload in Action

Update `agents.yaml` while Hive is running:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: researcher
    role: "Research information and gather data"
    llm: claude
    temperature: 0.7  # Added parameter
    tools:
      - web-search
      - wikipedia
      - arxiv  # Added new tool
```

Save the file - changes apply **instantly** without restart!

```bash
# Check updated configuration
hive agents list

# researcher now has arxiv tool available
```

---

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

Have agents work together on complex tasks:

```bash
# Create a workflow
hive workflow create product-launch.yaml
```

`product-launch.yaml`:
```yaml
name: product-launch
description: Complete product launch workflow

steps:
  - agent: researcher
    task: "Research target market and competitors"
    output: market-research

  - agent: writer
    task: "Create product description based on research"
    input: market-research
    output: product-copy

  - agent: analyst
    task: "Analyze product positioning and suggest improvements"
    input: product-copy
    output: analysis-report

parallel:
  - agent: coder
    task: "Build landing page"
  - agent: writer
    task: "Write blog announcement"
```

Execute the workflow:

```bash
hive workflow run product-launch
```

## Pro Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Simple, Scale Up">
    Begin with 2-3 specialized agents, then add more as needed:

    ```yaml
    # Start with
    agents:
      - name: assistant
        role: "General purpose helper"

    # Then expand to
    agents:
      - name: researcher
      - name: coder
      - name: writer
      - name: analyst
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Memory Strategically">
    Enable memory for agents that need context:

    ```yaml
    - name: researcher
      memory: true  # Needs to remember findings

    - name: calculator
      memory: false  # Pure computation, no context needed
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Agent Performance">
    ```bash
    # View agent activity
    hive agents status

    # Check memory usage
    hive memory stats

    # View task history
    hive tasks history --agent researcher
    ```
  </Accordion>

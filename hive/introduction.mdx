## What is Hive?

Hive is an **enterprise-grade multi-agent orchestration system** that makes deploying AI agent teams as simple as writing a YAML file. With MCP integration, persistent memory, RAG capabilities, and hot-reload built-in, Hive transforms complex AI infrastructure into a simple configuration file.

## The Problem

Deploying AI agents to production is unnecessarily complex:
- **Weeks of Setup**: Complex infrastructure requirements
- **Integration Hell**: Every service requires custom code
- **No Memory**: Agents forget context between sessions
- **Manual Restarts**: Code changes require full redeployments
- **Knowledge Gaps**: No easy way to give agents domain knowledge

## The Solution

Hive provides **production-ready AI orchestration** out of the box:

## Why "Hive"?

A hive is a **complex, coordinated system** where individual agents (bees) work together toward common goals. Each member has specialized roles, they communicate efficiently, and the collective achieves far more than individuals could alone.

## Philosophy

Hive embodies our core philosophy:

<Card title="AI that elevates human potential, not replaces it" icon="users">
  - **You orchestrate** - Agents execute
  - **You configure** - Hive manages
  - **You understand** - Agents explain
  - **You own** - Self-hostable infrastructure
